[__Open Ephys++__](https://jonnew.github.io/open-ephys-pcie/) is hardware, firmware, communication protocols,
specifications, and APIs for serialized, very-high channel count, closed-loop
electrophysiology. It is an evolution of the hardware and software introduced
in [open ephys project](http://www.open-ephys.org/) and involves many of the
same developers. The firmware and API are general purpose -- they can be used
to acquire from and control custom headstages with arbitrary arrangements of
sensors and actuators (e.g. cameras, bioamplifier chips, LED drivers, etc.) and
are not limited to the hardware in this repository.

This project is currently maintained by [jonnew](https://github.com/jonnew).

## Features

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/open-ephys-pcie/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/open-ephys-pcie/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/open-ephys-pcie/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

- Firmware and API permit acquisition and control of arbitrary arrangements of
  sensors and actuators:

    - Miniscopes
    - Headstages
    - Photometry systems
    - Etc. 

- Submillisecond round-trip communication from brain, through host PC's main
  memory, and back again.
- Flagship headstages:

    - 64-, 128-, 256-channels of electrophysiology
    - Optogenetic stimulation
    - Electrical stimulation
    - 3D-pose measurement
    - Data, user control, and power via a tiny coaxial cable 
    - Wireless communication 

- Formal specifications: serialization protocols, host communication protocols,
  and host API
- Low-level API implementation
- High-level API language bindings and existing integration with [Open Ephys
  GUI](http://www.open-ephys.org/gui/) and [Bonsai](http://bonsai-rx.org/).
- Quality documentation and easy routes to purchasing assembled devices.
